* One of my biggest interests is traveling.  This year alone I have been to Dubai, Egypt, Jordan, Netherlands, England, Scotland and Ireland.
* Another of my interests in whiskey.  I am part of a club that seeks out and trys many different kinds of whiskeys from around the world.
* I also enjooy the outdoors.  I enjoy golfing with friends, hiking in California and also anything to do on the water.  I enjoy boating, riding jet ski's, and swimming to name a few.

### *Technical Background*

My technical experience is fairly limimted. My brother has a computer company called Imperial Computer Solutions that I helped out at here and there, but for the most part all of my experience has been in the educational setting. I have taken classes in C#, Java and C++. I enjoy learning new technologies and also how to build things.
